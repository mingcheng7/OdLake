Below are the files in OdLake model codes part: 

      odlake_v0.1: the main process of the model. Use the function in this file to solve the lake simulation. 
      
      modelinputs: the input part, inputting the '.xlsx' data and preliminary data processing. 
      
      heatflux: solve the daily heat flux. Also using Air-Sea toolbox.
